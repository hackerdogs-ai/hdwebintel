# 🎓 Pillar 12: Security Awareness & Training

**Scenarios to Protect:**

* Employees falling victim to phishing/social engineering
* Insider threats from lack of awareness of security policies
* Poor handling of sensitive data (shadow IT, unsafe file sharing, password reuse)
* Weak overall security culture across the enterprise

**Design Points:**

* Continuous security awareness programs (not once-a-year checkboxes)
* Phishing simulations and adaptive learning
* Role-based security training (executives, developers, admins, general staff)
* Integration of awareness metrics into KPIs
* Positive reinforcement and gamification to improve adoption

## 1. Roles & Ownership

### **Strategic Roles (Policy, Oversight, Governance)**

* **CISO:** Owns enterprise security culture strategy; accountable to executives/board.
* **Head of Security Awareness & Culture:** Designs program, defines KPIs, selects platforms/vendors.
* **HR Director / Chief People Officer:** Ensures security awareness is part of onboarding and performance management.
* **Principal Security Architect:** Advises on role-based technical training (e.g., for developers, admins).

### **Execution Roles (Implementation, Operations, Monitoring)**

* **Security Awareness Program Manager:** Runs phishing simulations, tracks completion metrics, manages training cycles.
* **Training & Communications Team:** Creates learning content, newsletters, and campaigns.
* **SOC Analyst:** Monitors phishing campaign results and correlates real-world incidents.
* **IT Helpdesk:** Provides first-line support for user security questions.
* **Developers / Engineers:** Participate in role-specific secure coding training.
* **Line Managers:** Enforce training completion within teams.

## 2. Role Tasks & Cadence

### **Daily Tasks**

* Send out micro-learning content / security tips (Training Team).
* Monitor employee-reported phishing attempts (SOC).
* Respond to awareness-related support requests (Helpdesk).

### **Weekly Tasks**

* Run targeted phishing simulations (Awareness Program Manager).
* Publish internal security newsletter or intranet updates.
* Review phishing report success/failure rates.

### **Monthly Tasks**

* Deliver role-based training modules (e.g., devs → secure coding, finance → fraud prevention).
* Host live or virtual lunch-and-learn security sessions.
* Analyze simulation data and update training material accordingly.

### **Quarterly Tasks**

* Conduct company-wide phishing simulations (including executives).
* Review awareness KPIs with leadership (CISO + Awareness Head).
* Run gamification/competitions (team-based security challenges).
* Update training content to reflect new threats (e.g., AI-enabled phishing).

### **Yearly Tasks**

* Enterprise-wide mandatory compliance training (PCI, HIPAA, SOX).
* Full-scale security culture survey to benchmark maturity.
* Update security awareness policy and training roadmap.
* External benchmarking against industry peers.
