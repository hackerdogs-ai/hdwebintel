✅ Got it. We’re now at **Pillar 20: TRADINT (Trade & Supply Chain Intelligence)**.
I’ll strictly follow the **pillar template** structure for **Step 1: Pillar Definition**.

Here’s the **full Step 1 (TRADINT Definition)**:

# 📦 Pillar 20: Trade & Supply Chain Intelligence (TRADINT)

---

## 1. Scenarios to Protect

* 🚢 **Sanctions Evasion**: Illicit entities masking trade routes, transshipment hubs, and shell companies.
* 📉 **Economic Warfare**: Manipulated supply chains to exert political or economic pressure.
* 🏭 **Dual-Use Goods**: Tracking items with civilian + military applications (e.g., drones, chips).
* 🕵️ **Illicit Networks**: Smuggling, counterfeit goods, wildlife trafficking, human trafficking linked to supply routes.
* 🌍 **Geopolitical Risk**: Trade disruptions from conflict zones, tariffs, embargoes, and pandemics.
* 🔎 **Corporate Risk**: Vendor fraud, ESG violations, reputational exposure through opaque suppliers.
* ⚠️ **Critical Dependencies**: Rare earth minerals, semiconductors, and energy supply chains at risk.
* 🛑 **Customs & Compliance**: Monitoring tariff code abuse, misclassification, and duty evasion.

---

## 2. Design Points

* 🌐 **Multi-Source Integration**: Customs filings, shipping manifests, satellite AIS, ADS-B, company registries.
* 🔗 **Entity Resolution**: Linking companies ↔ shipments ↔ owners ↔ sanctions lists.
* 🚦 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Container movement tracking, port congestion, rerouted supply chains.
* 📊 **Trade Graphs**: Visualizing cross-border flows of goods, entities, and capital.
* 🧩 **Cross-Pillar Fusion**:

  * **FININT** for illicit money flows.
  * **VATINT/ORBINT** for ship & aircraft movements.
  * **LEGINT** for regulatory/compliance data.
* 📉 **Anomaly Detection**: Spotting unusual trade volumes, pricing anomalies, or fictitious shell exporters.
* 📜 **Policy Compliance**: Integration with AML/CFT, customs compliance, and WTO regulations.
* ⚡ **Automation**: API-driven collection of manifests, registries, and global trade databases.
* 🧪 **Predictive Analytics**: Anticipating shortages, bottlenecks, or fraud through ML.
