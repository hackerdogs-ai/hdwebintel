# 🤖 Pillar 22: AI-INT (Artificial Intelligence Intelligence)

---

## 1. Scenarios to Protect

1. **AI-powered disinformation** – synthetic media (deepfakes, fake text, auto-generated images/videos) spreading at scale.
2. **Adversarial ML attacks** – poisoning OSINT datasets, evading classifiers, or manipulating AI-driven monitoring.
3. **AI-assisted cybercrime** – generative models used for phishing, malware development, or vulnerability discovery.
4. **Autonomous botnets** – AI-controlled bots managing C2 operations, data exfiltration, or fake traffic.
5. **Synthetic identity creation** – AI-generated personas used to infiltrate platforms, forums, or supply chains.
6. **Model provenance & leakage** – stolen or misused AI models, weights, or embeddings leaked on dark web.
7. **Prompt injection & LLM abuse** – OSINT workflows compromised by malicious prompt engineering.
8. **Cross-pillar AI fusion** – adversaries fusing SOCMINT, CYBINT, and HUMINT with AI to generate faster attacks.
9. **AI policy circumvention** – misuse of open-source models to bypass ethical constraints.
10. **Defensive AI monitoring** – failure to detect/monitor AI-driven threats early, leading to blind spots.

## 2. Design Points

* **Dual perspective**: monitor AI as both an *enabler* (defensive/analytic) and as a *target* (weaponization by adversaries).
* **Synthetic media detection**: image, video, and voice deepfake detection pipelines integrated into OSINT workflows.
* **Model & dataset telemetry**: monitor model leaks, fine-tune datasets, and AI infrastructure metadata.
* **Adversarial resilience**: continuously test ML/LLM models against prompt injection, poisoning, and evasion.
* **Threat actor monitoring**: track AI tool usage in forums, GitHub, Telegram, and dark web marketplaces.
* **Governance & compliance**: monitor AI usage against NIST AI Risk Management, EU AI Act, and ISO/IEC 42001.
* **Cross-pillar fusion**: connect SOCMINT (AI-driven influence ops), CYBINT (AI-based malware), and HUMINT (AI tradecraft).
* **Red-teaming AI**: adversarial testing of generative AI models and OSINT ML pipelines.
* **Transparency layer**: maintain audit logs of AI-generated vs. human-generated intelligence.
* **Scalable infrastructure**: GPU/TPU monitoring for large-scale AI threat scanning.
