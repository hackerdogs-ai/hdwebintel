# **Step 2: VATINT Dashboard Definition 🚗✈️🚢**

---

## **1. Dashboard Sections**

1. **🌍 Real-Time Transport Monitoring**

   * Maritime (AIS) feeds, Aviation (ADS-B) feeds, Ground GPS data.
   * Interactive maps with **dark activity alerts** and spoofing indicators.

2. **📊 Anomaly & Risk Detection**

   * Route deviations, loitering events, AIS/ADS-B spoofing.
   * Heatmaps of high-risk transport corridors.

3. **📡 Watchlist & Sanctions Monitoring**

   * High-risk vessels, aircraft, and trucking companies.
   * Automated cross-check with OFAC, EU, UN, and national sanctions lists.

4. **📑 Investigations & Case Management**

   * RFI/RFQ tracking for smuggling, dark activity, or aviation threats.
   * Integrated handoff to TheHive, MISP, OpenCTI, and SOAR.

5. **🛠 ML & Model Monitoring**

   * Performance of VATINT detection models (precision, recall, drift).
   * Alerts on adversarial evasion (signal spoofing, multi-hop routing).

6. **⚖️ Compliance & Audit**

   * IMO/ICAO/IATA transport compliance checks.
   * Data privacy/PII audit logs.

7. **📈 Executive Briefing View**

   * Dark vessel & suspicious flight statistics.
   * ROI metrics (time saved, sanctions actions enforced, interdictions).

## **2. Widgets**

* **🌍 Global Map (Interactive)**

  * Layered AIS, ADS-B, GPS data feeds.
  * Filters: vessel type, airline, trucking firm, sanction status.

* **🚨 Dark Activity Alerts Panel**

  * Daily high-priority alerts: dark ships, spoofed flights, border-crossing vehicles.
  * Severity levels: P1–P4.

* **📊 Route Deviation Heatmap**

  * Weekly update of top 10 deviations.
  * Drill-down into evidence (imagery, signals, cross-pillar).

* **📡 Watchlist Dashboard**

  * Top 100 vessels/aircraft under monitoring.
  * Status: Active / Dormant / Sanctioned.

* **🤖 Model Drift Monitor**

  * VATINT anomaly model performance trends.
  * KPIs: precision, recall, F1, drift index.

* **📑 Investigation Tracker**

  * Active RFIs with SLA timers.
  * Assigned agent, handoffs, expected output.

* **⚖️ Compliance Snapshot**

  * IMO/ICAO audit coverage %
  * GDPR/NIS2 compliance status
  * Last audit date

* **📈 Executive Metrics Panel**

  * Dark activity detection rate (%)
  * Sanctions enforcement actions (#)
  * Cross-pillar validation %
  * Analyst efficiency (alerts/action ratio)

---

## **3. Metrics**

### 🔹 **Strategic (Executive-Level KPIs)**

* 🚢 Dark Vessel Detection Rate (%)
* ✈️ Suspicious Flight Anomaly Detection Rate (%)
* ⏱ Mean Time to Detection (MTTD, hrs)
* 🌍 Sanctions Violation Alert Rate (%)
* 📈 Route Deviation Risk Index (0–100)
* 📊 Executive Adoption (% briefs used in decision-making)

### 🔹 **Operational (Analyst KPIs)**

* 📡 Feed Uptime (%) (AIS, ADS-B, GPS)
* 🚛 Coverage Breadth (# ships, aircraft, trucks monitored)
* 🧩 Cross-Pillar Validation Rate (%)
* 📢 Alerts Actionability (%)
* 🔍 Verification Accuracy (against ground truth)
* 🤖 Model Precision/Recall (≥0.85 threshold)
* 📑 SLA Compliance (% of RFIs delivered on time)

---

## **4. Reporting & Frequency**

* **Daily Reports:** Dark activity feed, vessel/flight anomaly summaries.
* **Weekly Reports:** Regional VATINT summaries + cross-pillar correlation.
* **Monthly Reports:** Attribution of illicit transport networks, environmental/route assessments.
* **Quarterly Reports:** Crisis simulation results, VATINT model audit.
* **Yearly Reports:** Strategic VATINT maturity review, sanctions enforcement outcomes.
