# 📘 **Step 1: NATINT (Natural Resources Intelligence) Pillar Definition**

---

## 1. Definition & Scope 🌍

**Natural Resources Intelligence (NATINT)** focuses on the **collection, analysis, and interpretation of intelligence related to natural resources** — including water, energy, minerals, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. It is crucial for governments, corporations, and NGOs seeking to anticipate **resource conflicts, supply chain risks, environmental security issues, and strategic dependencies**.

This pillar supports:

* Tracking of **critical raw materials** (rare earths, lithium, cobalt, uranium).
* Monitoring **global energy flows** (oil, gas, renewables).
* Assessing **agriculture, food security, and water availability**.
* Identifying **illegal exploitation** (mining, logging, overfishing).
* Understanding **geopolitical leverage** derived from resource control.

---

## 2. Problems Solved 🎯

* Anticipate **resource-driven conflicts** and disputes (e.g., water wars, oil chokepoints).
* Map **strategic dependencies** (rare earths, lithium, energy pipelines).
* Detect **illegal activities** (smuggling, illegal mining, deforestation, overfishing).
* Monitor **climate-driven scarcity** and migration triggers.
* Support **policy & investment decisions** in energy, food, and commodities.
* Provide **early warning** of disruptions to global supply chains.

---

## 3. Role Tasks & Cadence ⏱️

**On-Demand (RFI/Investigations):**

* Resource site geolocation & verification (mines, forests, dams).
* Attribution of illegal exploitation events.
* Vendor due diligence in natural resource contracts.

**Daily:**

* Monitor commodity prices and supply disruptions.
* Track satellite feeds for environmental/resource anomalies.
* Flag illegal trade flows (timber, fish, minerals).

**Weekly:**

* Generate regional supply-demand balance updates.
* Summarize regulatory changes in key exporting countries.
* Report on environmental/resource-related protests.

**Monthly:**

* Produce commodity trend reports (energy, metals, food).
* Map strategic dependencies by country/sector.
* Analyze climate/resource risk drivers.

**Quarterly:**

* Executive briefings on geopolitical leverage of resources.
* Benchmark resilience of supply chains (energy, minerals, food).
* Publish cross-pillar risk insights (ECOINT + FININT + CYBINT linkages).

**Yearly:**

* Global natural resources assessment (water, energy, minerals, agriculture).
* Long-term resource forecast & scenario modeling.
* NATINT strategy maturity and investment roadmap.
