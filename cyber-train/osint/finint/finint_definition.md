Perfect 👍 — here is the **full Step 1: Pillar Definition for FININT (Financial Intelligence from Open Sources)**, built in **world-class detail** and strictly following the six-section template.

# 💰 **Step 1: Pillar Definition – FININT (Financial Intelligence from Open Sources)**

---

### **1. Scenarios to Protect**

* 🏦 **Money laundering (ML):** illicit funds moving through shell companies, casinos, real estate.
* 🛑 **Sanctions evasion:** sanctioned individuals/entities exploiting offshore havens, front companies, or crypto rails.
* 💳 **Terrorist financing:** detection of funding pipelines via hawala, NGOs, or prepaid cards.
* 🔗 **Procurement & supply chain risk:** hidden ownership structures in critical vendors.
* 🪙 **Cryptocurrency tracing:** ransomware payments, mixers/tumblers, cross-chain laundering.
* 🕵️ **Corporate fraud:** insider trading, accounting manipulation, stock pump-and-dump.
* 🚩 **Trade-based ML:** false invoicing, over/under-invoicing, phantom shipments.
* 🌍 **Illicit networks:** kleptocracy, oligarch financial ecosystems, offshore trust structures.
* 🔐 **Bribery & corruption:** financial leakages in public sector contracts.
* 💼 **Cybercrime monetization:** carding, cash-out networks, mule accounts.

---

### **2. Design Points**

* 🌍 **Data breadth:** combine corporate registries, sanctions lists, leaks (Panama/Paradise), NGO reports, and blockchain ledgers.
* 🧠 **AI/ML:** entity resolution (fuzzy matching across languages), anomaly detection (suspicious transaction patterns).
* 🔗 **Cross-pillar links:**

  * FININT → HUMINT (source validation of financial actors).
  * FININT → SIGINT (linking transaction metadata to comms).
  * FININT → CYBERINT (crypto ransomware tracing).
* ⚖️ **Compliance:** align with AML (FATF 40 Recommendations), OFAC, EU AMLD, GDPR.
* 🕸️ **Network analytics:** graph approaches to uncover hidden beneficial owners and layered laundering.
* 🧾 **Auditability:** provenance and chain-of-custody for every financial finding.
* 🧩 **Scalability:** modular ingestion pipelines for registries, leaks, blockchain nodes.

---

### **4. Role Tasks & Cadence**

**Daily 🗓️**

* Monitor new sanctions updates (OFAC, EU, UN).
