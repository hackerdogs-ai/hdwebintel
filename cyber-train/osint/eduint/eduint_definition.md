Excellent ✅ — moving on to the next pillar in your OSINT list: **EDUINT (Educational Intelligence)**.
As always, I will follow the **pillar template strictly** (Definition, Problems Solved, Roles & Cadence, Tools ≥12 OSS & ≥12 Commercial, Reporting & Metrics).

# 📘 **Step 1: EDUINT (Educational Intelligence) Pillar Definition**

---

## 1. Definition & Scope 🎓

**Educational Intelligence (EDUINT)** is the OSINT discipline focused on collecting, analyzing, and interpreting intelligence from the **education sector** — including universities, research labs, training institutions, student networks, and academic publications.
It provides visibility into:

* **Academic research output** (STEM, defense, biotech, AI).
* **Talent pipelines** (student mobility, scholarships, exchange programs).
* **Research collaborations & funding flows** (public/private/foreign).
* **Campus activism & radicalization** (early indicators of political/social unrest).
* **Institutional risks** (espionage, technology transfer, insider threats).

EDUINT serves as a **strategic intelligence source** for governments, think tanks, and enterprises tracking innovation, influence, and threats emerging from academia.

---

## 2. Problems Solved 🎯

* Identify **emerging technologies** before they hit the market (via theses, dissertations, patents, and preprints).
* Detect **foreign influence or espionage** in research programs.
* Map **academic collaborations** linked to adversarial states or companies.
* Track **talent migration** and “brain drain” risks.
* Monitor **campus protests, extremism, or activism** that may escalate.
* Assess risks of **dual-use research** (e.g., biotech, AI, defense).
* Provide **early warning** on academic cyber-espionage campaigns.
