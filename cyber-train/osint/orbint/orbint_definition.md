# **Pillar 19: ORBINT (Orbital Intelligence) 🚀🛰️**

---

## **1. Scenarios**

1. **Satellite Tracking** – Monitoring active satellites (commercial, military, dual-use) for positional awareness.
2. **Launch Intelligence** – Identifying and analyzing rocket launches and payload attribution.
3. **Debris & Collision Risk** – Detecting orbital debris, conjunction alerts, and potential collision scenarios.
4. **Dual-Use Satellites** – Monitoring satellites that may serve both civilian and military purposes.
5. **RF Emission Monitoring** – Detecting signals from satellites for COMINT/SIGINT crossover.
6. **Space Domain Situational Awareness (SSA)** – Real-time mapping of orbital objects.
7. **Adversarial Maneuvers** – Detecting suspicious satellite movements (rendezvous, co-orbital threats).
8. **Commercial Space Infrastructure Monitoring** – Tracking private operators and mega-constellations (Starlink, OneWeb).
9. **Geopolitical Analysis** – Mapping satellite assets to nation-state capabilities and military doctrines.
10. **Cross-Pillar Fusion** – Linking orbital activity with THREAT\_INTEL, CYBINT, and GEOINT for holistic space awareness.
