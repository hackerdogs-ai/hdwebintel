# 🖥️ **Step 1: CYBINT Pillar Definition**

---

## **1. Pillar Overview**

**Definition:**
Cyber Intelligence (CYBINT) is the collection, processing, and analysis of data from digital networks, systems, and cyber operations to detect, understand, and mitigate cyber threats.

**Purpose:**

* Provide **early warning** of intrusions, malware, and data breaches.
* Correlate cyber threat indicators with OSINT and enterprise telemetry.
* Enable proactive **threat hunting, attribution, and incident response**.
* Bridge tactical (IOCs), operational (campaigns, TTPs), and strategic (risk, geopolitics) cyber intelligence.

**Scope:**
Covers cyber threat feeds, malware intel, intrusion sets, ransomware, vulnerability exploitation, network traffic intel, and dark web cybercriminal ecosystems.

## **2. Key Scenarios**

1. 🕵️ **Intrusion Detection & Attribution** – Detect C2 infra, phishing domains, malware families, and attribute campaigns.
2. 🦠 **Malware Intelligence** – Track ransomware strains, botnets, and exploit kits.
3. ⚡ **Incident Response Support** – Provide enriched IOCs, YARA rules, and playbooks.
4. 📊 **Cyber Threat Reports** – Tactical + operational + strategic reporting to SOC, CISO, board.
5. 🌐 **Threat Actor Infrastructure Tracking** – Monitor C2 servers, DNS records, TLS certs.
6. 🚨 **Zero-Day & Exploit Intel** – Early warnings from deep/dark web chatter and vendor feeds.
7. 🔐 **Credential & Data Leak Detection** – Monitor forums, paste sites, breaches.
8. 🛡 **Vulnerability Prioritization** – Align vuln scanning with exploitability intelligence.
9. 📡 **Phishing & Ransomware Campaign Monitoring** – Track TTPs and infrastructure reuse.
10. 🧭 **Fusion & Correlation** – Enrich SOC telemetry with global threat intel.

## **3. Role Tasks & Cadence**

### 🎯 **Strategic Roles**

* **Cyber Intelligence Strategist** – Shapes CYBINT program, aligns with enterprise cyber risk posture.
* **CISO / Executive Consumers** – Review strategic cyber threat briefings.

### ⚙️ **Operational Roles**

* **Cyber Threat Analyst** – Collects & correlates intrusion data, malware IOCs.
* **Malware Reverse Engineer** – Dissects samples, generates detection rules.
* **Threat Hunter** – Uses enriched CYBINT to guide hunts across SIEM/EDR.
* **Vulnerability Intelligence Analyst** – Tracks CVEs, exploits, and vuln priorities.
* **Data Engineer** – Maintains pipelines for cyber feeds, sandboxes, and enrichment APIs.

### 📅 **Cadence**

* **On-Demand:** IOC enrichment, malware analysis, breach investigation.
* **Daily:** Feed ingestion, malware sample analysis, dark web monitoring.
* **Weekly:** Actor/campaign tracking, exploit chatter monitoring.
* **Monthly:** Threat landscape and vuln exploitation reports.
* **Quarterly:** Executive threat briefs, ROI reviews.
* **Yearly:** Strategy refresh, vendor review, and capability maturity assessment.

## **5. Problems Solved & Success Metrics**

### ⚡ **Problems Solved**

* Raw feed overload → normalized, enriched, prioritized cyber threat data.
* Delayed response to ransomware & phishing → accelerated detection & disruption.
* Lack of context in vuln scanning → risk-based prioritization using threat exploitation data.
* Fragmented dark web monitoring → consolidated exploit & chatter feeds.
* Low exec visibility → clear reporting of cyber threat ROI & metrics.

### 📈 **Success Metrics**

* **IOC Enrichment Success ≥ 90%**
* **False Positive Reduction ≥ 30%**
* **Detection Lead Time Reduced ≥ 25%** (threat → SOC detection)
* **≥ 85% Accuracy** for campaign attribution
* **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) < 1 hour** for high-severity IOCs
* **≥ 2 Executive Decisions Influenced / quarter**
* **Compliance Audit Pass Rate 100%**
* **IOC Efficacy (SIEM hit rate) ≥ 70%**
