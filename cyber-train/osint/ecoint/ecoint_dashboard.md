Perfect — moving into **Step 2 for EcoINT (Ecological Intelligence)**, strictly following the same template structure we’ve used for the other pillars.

---

# 📊 EcoINT Dashboard Definition

## **1. Dashboard Purpose**

Provide a **centralized, real-time ecological intelligence hub** for monitoring environmental risks, compliance, and crises. The dashboard empowers **executives** (CRO, CSO, ESG leaders) with **strategic decision-making insights**, while giving **analysts** operational visibility into ecological datasets, environmental crimes, and compliance violations.

---

## **2. Dashboard Sections**

### 🌍 Executive Overview (Strategic)

* **EcoRisk Index (Gauge)** → overall ecological exposure score (climate, biodiversity, pollution).
* **Global Impact Heatmap (Choropleth)** → regions with highest environmental risk.
* **Carbon Footprint Tracker (Line Chart)** → carbon emissions trend by sector & geography.
* **Top Emerging Risks (KPI Cards)** → new hotspots: deforestation, illegal fishing, pollution surges.
* **Sustainability Goal Progress (Progress Bars)** → ESG/SDG targets vs. reality.

---

### 🔎 Real-Time Environmental Monitoring (Analyst)

* **Live Eco Feed (Stream/Feed Table)** → incoming signals from APIs, sensors, satellite data.
* **Deforestation Alerts (Panel)** → AOIs flagged from Global Forest Watch / Sentinel.
* **Pollution Dashboard (Heatmap)** → air/water pollution levels across AOIs.
* **Wildlife & Biodiversity Panel (Grid)** → poaching incidents, species population changes.
* **Ocean & Water Intelligence (Wave Chart)** → illegal fishing, water scarcity alerts.

---

### 🧭 Climate & Disaster Intelligence

* **Extreme Weather Alerts (Card Stack)** → hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires.
* **Disaster Impact Estimator (Bar/Scatter)** → affected population, cost, carbon released.
* **Recovery & Response Tracker (Timeline)** → crisis-to-recovery stages for disasters.
* **GeoEco Timeline (Animated Map)** → forest cover change, glacial retreat, urban expansion.

---

### 💼 Compliance & ESG Oversight

* **ESG Compliance Score (Gauge)** → company-by-company or sector risk rating.
* **Greenwashing Detector (Table + Flags)** → anomalies in sustainability reporting.
* **Carbon Credit Registry Tracker (Panel)** → validation of claimed offsets vs. actual.
* **Corporate Offenders List (Card Grid)** → entities violating climate & ecological rules.

---

### 💰 Resource & Commodity Intelligence

* **Energy Mix Tracker (Pie/Bar)** → renewable vs. fossil production.
* **Mining & Extraction Monitor (Table)** → track illegal mining/logging signals.
* **Commodity Exposure Dashboard (Line/Bar)** → deforestation-linked commodities (palm oil, soy, cattle).
* **Critical Minerals Monitor (KPI)** → lithium, cobalt, rare earths extraction/risks.

---

### 🔔 Alerts & Response

* **Active EcoINT Alerts (Panel)** → real-time environmental incidents.
* **Severity Distribution (Donut)** → P1/P2/P3 breakdown.
* **Alert-to-Response SLA (KPI)** → average time from detection to action.
* **SOAR Integration (Case Panel)** → case sync with TIP/OpenCTI/MISP.

---

## **3. Metrics (Aligned to Step 1)**

**Strategic Metrics**

* 🌍 EcoRisk Index (composite)
* 📉 Sustainability Goal Progress
* 🏭 Emissions Reduction % (by sector/region)
* 💰 Commodity/Resource Risk Index
* 🧾 ESG Compliance Rate

**Operational Metrics**

* 🪵 Deforestation Detection Accuracy (%)
* 💨 Pollution Coverage (AQI/Water sources monitored)
* 🐘 Wildlife Incident Validation Rate (%)
* 🌊 Illegal Fishing Detection Precision/Recall
* ⏱️ Lead Time Advantage (alerts vs. crisis confirmation)

---

## **4. Dashboard Technology & Implementation**

* **Visualization**: Streamlit, Grafana, Kibana for live dashboards.
* **Geospatial**: QGIS, Kepler.gl, Google Earth Engine for map overlays.
* **Data Stores**: PostgreSQL/PostGIS, ElasticSearch, S3 for large raw imagery dumps.
* **Graph DB**: Neo4j/ArangoDB for corporate-environment link analysis.
* **Alerting**: Slack/Teams integration + SOAR systems.
* **External Feeds**: Copernicus, NOAA, FAO, Global Forest Watch, OpenAQ, IUCN.

---

## **5. Example Layout (EcoINT Fusion Dashboard)**

* **Row 1**: EcoRisk Index, Global Heatmap, Carbon Tracker, ESG Score.
* **Row 2**: Deforestation Alerts, Live Eco Feed, Pollution Heatmap, Wildlife Tracker.
* **Row 3**: Compliance Scorecards, Corporate Offenders List, Disaster Alerts, SOAR Cases.

✅ This gives us a **world-class EcoINT Dashboard**, aligned with the same rigor as SOCMINT, FININT, DARKINT etc., with both **strategic and operational focus**.

Would you like me to now move to **Step 3 (EcoINT agents.yaml & tasks.yaml)** so we complete this pillar?
