• What was the initial attack vector? (i.e., How did the adversary gain initial access to the network?)
• How is the adversary accessing the environment?
• Is the adversary exploiting vulnerabilities to achieve access or privilege?
• How is the adversary maintaining command and control?
• Does the actor have persistence on the network or device?
• What is the method of persistence (e.g., malware backdoor, webshell, legitimate credentials, remote tools, etc.)?
• What accounts have been compromised and what privilege level (e.g., domain admin, local admin, user account, etc.)?
• What method is being used for reconnaissance? (Discovering the reconnaissance method may provide an opportunity for
detection and to determine possible intent.)
• Is lateral movement suspected or known? How is lateral movement conducted (e.g., RDP, network shares, malware, etc.)?
• Has data been exfiltrated and, if so, what kind and via what mechanism?
