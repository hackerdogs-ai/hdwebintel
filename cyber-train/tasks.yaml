         - Categorize risks by type (operational, strategic, compliance, reputational)
         - Map risks to business processes and critical assets
         - Assess risk interdependencies and cascading effects
      
      2. Risk Analysis and Evaluation
         - Analyze risk likelihood using historical data and threat intelligence
         - Evaluate potential business impact and financial consequences
         - Assess current control effectiveness and residual risk levels
         - Quantify risk exposure using established risk metrics
      
      3. Risk Treatment and Mitigation
         - Develop comprehensive risk mitigation strategies
         - Prioritize risks based on likelihood and impact
         - Create risk treatment plans with timelines and resource requirements
         - Establish risk monitoring and review procedures
      
      4. Strategic Recommendations
         - Provide executive-level risk management recommendations
         - Align risk treatment with business objectives and budget constraints
         - Develop risk communication strategies for stakeholders
         - Establish risk governance and oversight frameworks
      
      Use the following approach:
      - Leverage industry frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, COSO)
      - Consider regulatory requirements and compliance obligations
      - Incorporate threat intelligence and industry benchmarks
      - Focus on business-aligned risk management strategies
    expected_output: >
