GENERATE SYNTHETIC CYBERSECURITY AND OSINT LABELED TRAINING DATA. 

1) Create a list of cybersecurity entities in the cyber-train/entities-intent folder. In the folder, each subfolder corresponds to a pillar. osint has its own pillars and you must inlcude that too. osint doesn't have SOP but it has all the other files. 
2) Create a separate entities and intent files for each pillar with the name [pillar]_entities.jsonl and [pillar]_intent.jsonl
3) Content must be in jsonl format
4) The content must include synthetic data generated for each pillar based on the following:
a) List of all the exhaustive entities within that pillar. Read the SOPs for the pillar, *_agents.yaml, *_definition.md, and *_tasks.yaml 
b) List of all the exhaustive intent within that pillar separated by each role mentioned in the SOP of that pillar.  
c) Intent each role doing their job and trying to solve issues as per their job and cadence and design the synthetic data accordingly.
d) Entties must include cybersecurity, pillar, and role related entities on top of generalized entities
5) The data must be labeled in jsonl format to train spacy for NER and intent extraction 
6) Use suggestions and hints from steps.txt but that's only for the labeling procedure for now.
7) YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTIVE IN GENERATING THE LAVELED DATA AS THIS IS BUSINESS CRITICAL AND IMPACTS THE REVENUES DIRECTLY. I WANT HIGH QUALITY AND REALISTIC DATA. ASSUME THE ROLE OF CYBERSECURITY AND OSINT EXPERT. 
DO NOT GENERATE ANY TRAINING CODE FOR NOW. GENERATE ONLY LABELED DATA FOR EACH PILLAR.
