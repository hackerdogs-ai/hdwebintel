# 🖥️ 15. Application Security Dashboard

### 🎯 Purpose

Provide **real-time visibility into application security posture** across custom apps, APIs, and third-party components. Enable **AppSec and DevSecOps teams** to detect vulnerabilities early, enforce secure coding practices, and monitor runtime protections, while allowing **CISO/leadership** to measure SSDLC maturity, vulnerability backlog, and compliance.
