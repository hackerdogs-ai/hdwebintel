# 🛠 4. Vulnerability Management

**Scenarios to Protect:**

* Software vulnerabilities in infrastructure, applications, and containers
* Unpatched systems exploited by attackers
* Misconfigurations creating exposure (cloud, SaaS, on-prem)

**Design Points:**

* Continuous vulnerability scanning and asset coverage
* Prioritization based on risk/context (CVSS, EPSS, exploitability)
* Automated patching & remediation workflows
* Integration with ITSM/DevOps for closure tracking

## 1. Roles & Ownership

### **Strategic Roles (Policy, Oversight, Risk Management)**

* **CISO:** Owns enterprise vulnerability risk posture, defines risk appetite, reports to board.
* **Principal Security Architect:** Designs vulnerability management architecture across endpoints, cloud, containers, OT.
* **Head of Vulnerability Management / Risk Manager:** Leads program strategy, SLAs, reporting, coordination with IT/DevOps.

### **Execution Roles (Implementation, Operations, Monitoring)**

* **Vulnerability Engineer:** Runs scans, triages vulnerabilities, manages patch cycles.
* **SOC Analyst:** Monitors for exploit attempts and correlates with vulnerability data.
* **Patch Management / IT Operations Team:** Executes OS/application patching and configuration changes.
* **DevSecOps Engineer:** Integrates container, IaC, and code scanning into pipelines.
* **AppSec Engineer:** Manages web/app vulnerability testing (DAST/SAST).
* **Red Team / Pen Tester:** Validates exploitation paths, tests remediation effectiveness.
* **System & Cloud Engineers:** Apply fixes in infrastructure and cloud platforms.

### **Quarterly Tasks**

* Full infrastructure and SaaS vulnerability assessment (Vuln Engineer).
* Penetration tests (Red Team).
* Cloud security posture review (Cloud Engineer).
* Adjust SLAs and remediation playbooks (Risk Manager).

### **Yearly Tasks**

* Update vulnerability management policy & SLAs (CISO + Architect).
* Third-party assessments & audits (External Auditors).
* Evaluate new vulnerability tools/vendors (Head of Vuln Mgmt).
* Run organization-wide “patch-a-thon” / tabletop simulation of critical vuln response (CISO + Red Team).
